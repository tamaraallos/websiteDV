            All data were sourced from the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics_health-data-en">OECD Health Statistics</a> datasets. The <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics/oecd-health-data-health-status_data-00540-en?parentId=http%3A%2F%2Finstance.metastore.ingenta.com%2Fcontent%2Fcollection%2Fhealth-data-en">Health status</a> dataset includes data about <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C1%7CHealth%23HEA%23%7CHealth%20status%23HEA_STA%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&bp=true&snb=16&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_HEALTH_STAT%40DF_COM&df[ag]=OECD.ELS.HD&df[vs]=1.0">Causes of mortality</a>, which formed the foundation of our final data.

            The unfiltered dataset contains ~952,000 data points, and was transformed in a relatively simple manner to reduce the overall size and bloat. As introduced in previous Data Science units, KNIME was utilised to smoothly mould our data to a more desirable form.
