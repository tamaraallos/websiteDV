            <h2>Visualisation Two: Stacked Area Chart</h2>
            
            <!-- <img src="resources/vis2-screenshot.png" alt="Static image of Visualisation Two"> -->
            
            <p>This visaulisation is of mortality data using a stacked bar chart. This is to showcase trends in deaths causes by
                a varity of different causes of mortality over time, grouped by decades. It allows users to interactively explore
                the causes of death by selecting specific gender, countries and causes, filtering the data dynamically.
                <br><br>
                The visualisation features colour-coded bars, where each cause of death is represented by a specific color, making
                it easier to compare. A tooltip is also added to provide further detail about specific causes and their associated
                death rates when users hover over the bar. There is a slight transition that also occurs when users do hover over a bar.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, a legend table is provided to provide clarity to users for what each cause colour represents as well as enabling users
                to toggle causes on and off. This updates the chart dynamically and shows only the selected causes. The causes filter restarts
                when users choose a different country/sex.
                <br><br>
                This is useful for public health professional, researchers, policymakers or people interested in mortality who want to track how
                mortality patterns evolve, identify patterns, prominent causes of death  in different countries, or evaluate the impact of
                health interventions over time. By visualisaing this data in a stacked bar chart, users can gain insights into trends quickly that would
                be difficult to see through raw datasets.
                <br><br>
                Muzner's guidelines and Tufte's design principles were taken into consideration when developing the stacked bar chart. The chart design
                emphiased on accuracy, clarity and effiency in portraying the data. Munzner's guideline focused on matching visual representation to the task,
                using appriopiate encodings, and balancing usability and complexity. While Tufte's principles of avoiding unncessary clutter, implementing
                data-ink maximisation and making sure that every visual element provides a purpose in communicating data insight. As a result of
                these principles, they help to create an informative and inuttive visualisaiton.

            <h2>Data Sources and Transformation</h2>

            <p>All data were sourced from the <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics_health-data-en">OECD Health Statistics</a> 
                datasets. The <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics/oecd-health-data-health-status_data-00540-en?parentId=http%3A%2F%2Finstance.metastore.ingenta.com%2Fcontent%2Fcollection%2Fhealth-data-en">Health status</a> 
                dataset includes data about <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C1%7CHealth%23HEA%23%7CHealth%20status%23HEA_STA%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&bp=true&snb=16&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_HEALTH_STAT%40DF_COM&df[ag]=OECD.ELS.HD&df[vs]=1.0">Causes of mortality</a>
                , which formed the foundation of our final data.
                <br>
                The unfiltered dataset contains ~952,000 data points, and was transformed in a relatively simple manner 
                to reduce the overall size and bloat. As introduced in previous Data Science units, <a href="https://www.knime.com">KNIME</a> 
                was utilised to smoothly mould our data to a more desirable form.
