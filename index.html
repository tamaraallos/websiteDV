            <p>This interactive choropleth, built using <a id="a0">D3.js</a>, presents global mortality rates for major 
                causes of death using data from the <a id="a1">OECD Health Statistics</a> reports. The data are 
                represented using a colour scale to quantise the relative severity of each cause across different sex, 
                and year, as well as offering a broad, at-a-glance comparison of any regional mortality patterns.
                <br><br>
                When the user hovers over any country on the choropleth, a detailed line chart appears. This line chart 
                illustrates mortality trends for the selected cause over time, spanning all available historical data. 
                This interactive feature enables users to not only compare global data but also to examine how a 
                particular cause of death has evolved in individual countries over the years. This line chart is 
                intended to serve a similar purpose as a generic tooltip, being that it grants the viewer an additional 
                level of information on top of the baseline choropoleth visualisation.
                <br><br>
                The choropleth is placed on a card-like element, which includes a legend to clarify the available user 
                interactions - a set of five hotkeys is available for use, each brushing the data in a distinct manner. 
                Users can filter data dynamically by toggling between different causes and years, enabling the chance to 
                identify regional or global patterns. The end-user experience has had considerable thought, with ease of 
                use and intuitive controls at front of mind. For those which suffer a colour-vision deficiency, an 
                alternate colour palette is accessible with the <code>f</code> (fill) key. For those interested in 
                scrubbing through the various causes for any particular country while viewing the full-time line chart, 
                the ability to use the <code>c</code> (cause) hotkey exists. For the baseline choropleth visualisation, 
                the user is also able to scrub through the years (forwards or backwards) with the left and right arrow 
                keys, and is able to cycle through the available sexes with the <code>s</code> key.
                <br><br>
                The intent for this visualisation was to provide a broad view of global rates of death from various 
                parent-level categories, rather than flood the viewer with over 50 distinct sub-categories; this design 
                approach was selected to not over-clutter the data and to ensure that the viewer is able to take in as 
                much information at a glance as possible without requiring manual thought. Ideally, the ability to view 
                pockets of geographical trends may allow health professionals, researchers, and even policymakers to 
                make changes to their understanding and approach towards public health at a global scale.

            <p>This visaulisation is of mortality data using a stacked bar chart. This is to showcase trends in deaths 
                causes by a varity of different causes of mortality over time, grouped by decades. It allows users to 
                interactively explore the causes of death by selecting specific gender, countries and causes, filtering 
                the data dynamically.
                <br><br>
                The visualisation features colour-coded bars, where each cause of death is represented by a specific 
                color, making it easier to compare. A tooltip is also added to provide further detail about specific 
                causes and their associated death rates when users hover over the bar. There is a slight transition that 
                also occurs when users do hover over a bar.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, a legend table is provided to provide clarity to users for what each cause colour represents as 
                well as enabling users to toggle causes on and off. This updates the chart dynamically and shows only 
                the selected causes. The causes filter restarts when users choose a different country/sex.
                <br><br>
                This is useful for public health professional, researchers, policymakers or people interested in 
                mortality who want to track how mortality patterns evolve, identify patterns, prominent causes of death 
                in different countries, or evaluate the impact of health interventions over time. By visualisaing this 
                data in a stacked bar chart, users can gain insights into trends quickly that would be difficult to see 
                through raw datasets.
                <br><br>
                Muzner's guidelines and Tufte's design principles were taken into consideration when developing the 
                stacked bar chart. The chart design emphiased on accuracy, clarity and effiency in portraying the data. 
                Munzner's guideline focused on matching visual representation to the task, using appriopiate encodings, 
                and balancing usability and complexity. While Tufte's principles of avoiding unncessary clutter, 
                implementing data-ink maximisation and making sure that every visual element provides a purpose in 
                communicating data insight. As a result of these principles, they help to create an informative and 
                inuttive visualisaiton.

            <h2>Data Sources and Transformation</h2>

            <p>All data were sourced from the <a id="a2"> OECD Health Statistics</a> datasets. The <a id="a3">Health 
                status</a> dataset includes data about <a id="a4">Causes of mortality</a>, which formed the foundation 
                of our final data.
                <br><br>
                The unfiltered dataset contains ~952,000 data points, and was transformed in a relatively simple manner 
                to reduce the overall size and bloat. As introduced in previous Data Science units, <a id="a5">KNIME</a> 
                was utilised to smoothly mould our data into a more desirable form.
